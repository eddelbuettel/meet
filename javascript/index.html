# Instructions for Table of Contents <pre>
# The table of contents normally is a plain list of papers (with titles/authors).
# The paper title should be linked to the paper URL (usually pdf).
# You may include "session" subsections e.g. to reflect the track structure of your workshop.
# Authors should be specified as comma-separated lists with full author names
# (like John Smith). Avoid glue words like 'by' and 'and'. If applicable, then lookup how
# the author is spelled out by DBLP.
# You may also provide additional material such as preface, bibtex files, complete 
# proceedings as a single pdf, and similar items. The additional items should be 
# clearly separated from the paper list, preferably after the table of contents.
# Please only tag original papers with the CEURTITLE/CEURAUTHORS scheme. Rather do not tag
# additional material with this scheme!
# For the time being, presentation slides should also not be tagged by CEURTITLE/CEURAUTHORS.
#</pre>


<div class="CEURTOC">
<h2> Table of Contents </h2>

# Prefaces, frontmatter etc. typically have no explicit authors.<pre>
# Note that the &lt;li id="..."&gt; attribute should have the same value as
# the name of the file linked to, just without the filename extension.
# This allows the table of contents entries to be linked to.
# </pre>
<ul>

# The session element is optional. It structures the table of contents.<pre>
# Each CEURSESSION must be followed by at least one paper using the li clause
# You can also use h3 subtitles without the CEURSESSION tag. Then, no
# restriction is imposed.

<h3><span class="CEURSESSION">Session 1: Introduction</span></h3>
